# Classifying Mushroom Genus Types from Images

- Objective: use transfer learning with several deep learning architectures (ResNet50, InceptionV3, VGG16) to classify mushroom images into one of nine genus types. The images are sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images).

- Learning Goal: apply the ideas learned from Andrew Ng's [deep learning Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
